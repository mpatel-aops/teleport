### Get a join token

Establish trust between your Teleport cluster and your new Application Service
instance by creating a join token:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=app --ttl=1h --format=text
(=presets.tokens.first=)
```

On the host where you will install the Teleport Application Service, create a
file called `/tmp/token` that consists only of your token:

```code
$ echo <Var name="join-token" /> | sudo tee /tmp/token
```
